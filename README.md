## Blurb
The Starlight / packcreator project recreates Magic: The Gathering draft booster pack generation to the highest fidelity possible with current information. It outputs these packs through Discord to a format usable by Tabletop Simulator.</br>
The Glintwing / drafthandler project is an event manager, using Discord to handle pairings for Magic: The Gathering draft events. The data is output to a somewhat human-readable JSON format intended to be usable by other projects.</br>

## Additional Notes
Nearly all rare sheets are randomly generated on JSON. These cannot realistically be reverse engineered.</br>
Some sets' information is currently unavailable. It is possible to reverse engineer more sets' contents, but it takes a lot of work and patience.</br>
The Discord bots use pycord as API wrappers.

## Credits
Thanks to the [lethe.xyz](https://www.lethe.xyz/mtg/collation/index.html) collation project for the collation data. This project is not affiliated with them, though. Consider donating to their Patreon.</br>
Thanks to Scryfall for the card data. This project is not affiliated with them either.</br>
Thanks to CubeCobra for hosting cubes and doing what they do. This project is also not affiliated with them.</br>
Thanks to Wizards of the Coast, as this project technically involves their intellectual property. As far as I am aware, I'm not violating any rules or laws with this project, and it is not affiliated with the company. Do not use this project to avoid having a Magic: The Gathering experience in paper, MTGO, or Arena. Frankly, this project is not an exact replica of real booster packs or the tournament rules, and the real thing is worth your money.</br>
Thanks to Discord, and of course this project isn't affiliated with them.
