Thanks to the [lethe.xyz](https://www.lethe.xyz/mtg/collation/index.html) collation project for the collation data. This project is not affiliated with them, though. Consider donating to their Patreon.</br>
Thanks to Wizards of the Coast, as this project technically involves their intellectual property. As far as I am aware, I'm not violating any rules or laws with this project, and it is not affiliated with the company. Do not use this project to avoid having a Magic: The Gathering experience in paper, on MTGO, or on Arena. Frankly, this project is not an exact replica of real booster packs or the tournament rules, and the real thing is worth your money.</br>
